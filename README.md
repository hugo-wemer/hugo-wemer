### Hi! I'm Hugo Wemer. 

I am a Christian and I have a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.

Passionate about programming, I use it in all areas where I can optimize time, organize processes, and perhaps most importantly, make things visually more elegant and accessible.
I have already ventured into several languages from low to high level, worked with AI creation, data science oriented processes, microcontroller programming among other things, but I have a deep passion for web development.

In the mid-2020s, I started studying web dev - much of my knowledge in the area was built around VueJs, NuxtJs and AdonisJs.
Currently I have focused my efforts on learning ReactJs, which has long been proving itself to be sovereign in the companies I admire the most.
